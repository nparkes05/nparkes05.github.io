        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>First time playing video games</h3>
            <p>
                I started playing video games at a young age. I started playing because my older brothers would be playing them. My brothers 
                and I had a competitive nature. So, they never went easy on me and I would have to play by myself in order to get better. We 
                would like to play games like Super Smash bro's melee together, Mario Kart, or Pokemon.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The first consoles I played on as a kid were the GameCube, the Nintendo 64, the Xbox 360, and the Wii. I always liked trying
                new games on the different consoles I had. But the game I enjoyed the most was Halo 3 on the Xbox 360. I played that game the 
                most growing up and it still remains one of my favorite games.

        <h2>How</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                The current way how I play video games is with a computer that I built. I built my computer back in 2019. It is currently
                my favorite method of playing games. The PC has the biggest library of video games. Also, my friends all play on PC so it's
                an easy way to connect with my friends.

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I started playing video games at a young age with my brothers. We were very competitive so we would play competitive games.
                We played fighting games like Super Smash bros, racing games like mario kart, and stategy games like Pokemon. So, I was 
                introduced to video games by my older brothers.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                I continue to play video games because I find it relaxing and allows me to connect with my friends. Video games allow me to
                relax after working. They distract my mind from anything that might have happened that day. So, I usually play video games
                around the end of the day in order to relax before going to sleep.
